abstract = {In this letter, we introduce a new image encryption algorithm based on iterating chaotic maps. Using the pseudorandom sequence generated by a group of one dimensional chaotic maps, the proposed algorithm realizes fast encryption and decryption of both gray-scale image and true color image. Moreover, the rounds of encryption could be set by the user. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation prove the proposed algorithm effective and secure.}
